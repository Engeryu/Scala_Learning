    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Object Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming or OPP is a model that organizes your program around the data. The alternative would be to organize \n",
    "around functions and logic. An object is commonly defined by its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP puts the objects at the heart of the computer program. The logic is then implemented to make the objects interact \n",
    "together. This type of software design is well suited for large and complex programs. It will make maintenance easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class and Objects in Scala\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, the minimal class declaration contains \n",
    "- the class keyword, \n",
    "- an identifier, the name of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Pizza(val name: String, val size: Double) {\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint to create as many objects as you need that will follow the same pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val `smallMargarita` = new Pizza(\"margarita\", 20)\n",
    "val hugeMargarita = new Pizza(\"margarita\", 50)\n",
    "val mediumFungi = new Pizza(\"fungi\", 35)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the attributes of the object like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "println(smallMargarita.name)\n",
    "println(smallMargarita.size)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor is a method that helps you create an object from the class.\n",
    "In our previous example, we create an object `smallMargarita` from the class `Pizza`.\n",
    "We called the constructor writing `new Pizza(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala is a very compact language therefore you can configure a lot in the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Public and private fields\n",
    "\n",
    "A public field is accessible outside the class. Use `val` or `var` before the field names\n",
    " \n",
    "```\n",
    "class Pizza(val name: String, val size: Double)\n",
    "\n",
    "val hugeMargarita = new Pizza(\"margarita\", 50)\n",
    "hugeMargarita.name // returns \"margarita\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A private field is not accessible outside the class. Define the field without `val` or `var`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Pizza(name: String, size: Double)\n",
    "\n",
    "val hugeMargarita = new Pizza(\"margarita\", 50)\n",
    "hugeMargarita.name // throws an error: value name is not a member of Pizza\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mutable and Immutable fields\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap what we learned yesterday, you can have \n",
    "- `var`: a mutable field. The value can be changed after the declaration.\n",
    "- `val`: an immutable field. The value cannot be changed after the declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Optional parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, a constructor allows you to have optional parameters. You need to provide default values when you declare the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Pizza(val name: String, val size: Double = 35) {\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are not only placeholders for data: they can also contain some logic. We use methods, functions that depend \n",
    "on the state of the class to implement the logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import scala.concurrent.duration._\n",
    "\n",
    "class Pizza(val name: String, val size: Double = 35) {\n",
    "    def getBakingTime: Duration  = {\n",
    "        Duration(3 * name.length * size, SECONDS)    \n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This baking time is strange, but it is a correct Scala program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods can be private. Therefore, they are only accessible from inside the class itself if you use the `private` keyword \n",
    "before `def`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case class\n",
    "\n",
    "Case classes are a great way to represent simple immutable data. They behave in the same as normal classes but have some nice build-in methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "case class Pizza(name: String)\n",
    "\n",
    "val margarita = Pizza(\"margarita\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that case classes have an `apply` method, this means you can drop the `new` to build an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case classes have their values public and immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val margarita = Pizza(\"margarita\")\n",
    "val anotherMargarita = Pizza(\"margarita\")\n",
    "\n",
    "margarita == anotherMargarita // returns true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Case classes compare objects base on their fields and not their reference as normal classes would.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "println(margarita) // prints Pizza(margarita)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Case classes have a toString method already implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Singleton objects\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a class that has exactly one instance. We have previously already seen one example with the Object holding \n",
    "the `main` method. They are called singleton objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Singleton objects can have attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "object MathUtils {\n",
    "     var PI = 3.14; \n",
    "\n",
    "     def square(x: Double): Double = {\n",
    "         x * x\n",
    "     }\n",
    " }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A singleton object cannot be instantiated. You can call the attributes and methods as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MathUtils.PI\n",
    "MathUtils.square(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism to base classes upon other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A Super Class**  is a normal class that will provide its attributes and methods to its sub classes.\n",
    "- **A Sub Class** is a class that inherits from the super class the attributes and methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you consider Boats, they all can float, have an average speed, etc.\n",
    "But then you have Sailboats that have a sail, Cargo that can transport containers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boat would be the Super Class\n",
    "- Sailboats, Cargo, ... would be the Sub Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, we use the keyword `extends` to create a sub class. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Boat(name: String, averageSpeedPerHour: Double){\n",
    "    def distanceTraveled(hours: Double): Double = {\n",
    "        averageSpeedPerHour * hours\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "class Cargo(name: String, averageSpeedPerHour: Double, capacity: Int) extends Boat(name, averageSpeedPerHour)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call the method of the class Boat on the cargo Object\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val cargo = new Cargo(\"Ahoy Cargo\", 5, 100)\n",
    "c.distanceTraveled(10) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traits\n",
    "\n",
    "You can almost consider traits in Scala as a Superclass. The main difference is that a class can extend multiple traits \n",
    "while a sub class can extend only one super class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "trait Human {\n",
    "    def walk(): Unit = {\n",
    "        println(\"I can walk\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "trait Bat {\n",
    "    def fly(): Unit = {\n",
    "        println(\"I can fly\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Batman extends Human with Bat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then call `fly()` and `walk()` on `Batman`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val batman = new Batman()\n",
    "batman.fly()\n",
    "batman.walk()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some References\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domain-driven design by Eric Evans**. This is a classic that most of the software engineers ~~should~~ have read.\n",
    "- **Building Microservices by Sam Newman**. This book is more advanced in the sense that microservices consider \n",
