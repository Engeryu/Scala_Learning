    "### Why should we use an IDE?\n",
    "\n",
    "> An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. [...] Integrated development environments are designed to maximize programmer productivity.

    "As we have seen previously, Scala needs to be compiled. Repeated many times, it can become cumbersome. Using an IDE will \n",
    "make the process of compiling and executing seamless.\n",

    "Many IDEs exist and can be used to implement Scala project.\n",
