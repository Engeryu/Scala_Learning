    "# The Basics of Scala\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Scala?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages are tools. You should find the right one to do the job. Note that you are part of the equations, \n",
    "some languages will be better for you because you believe they are easier to read. This is ok!\n",
    "\n",
    "This said you are learning Scala as part of the Lead program at Jedha Bootcamp because it was used to develop Apache Spark. \n",
    "It is a very powerful tool to process BigData using the map reduce paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have already seen earlier, Scala is compiled and executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This is very powerfull \n",
    "because you can use Java code in your Scala program and Scala Code is your Java program. Programs running on the JVM can \n",
    "be executed on any OS (macOS, Linux, and Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The main class\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, your program will have one entry point. It will be where your program starts. This is represented by a very \n",
    "special object with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "object HelloWorld {\n",
    "    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n",
    "        println(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the minimal piece of code to run a scala application. While the name of the object can be whatever you want, it\n",
    "needs to have a `main` method with `args: Array[String]` as argument and Unit as output type. It means that it won't \n",
    "return anything, but it might have side-effects, for example writing in a database.\n",
    "The arguments are a list of string you can pass to your program when you run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> scala HelloWorld first-arg second-arg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the rest of this course, you can use the Scala command-line interface to experiment the syntax.\n",
    "> Type `scala` in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Var vs Val\n",
    "\n",
    "As for Python, a variable is a pointer to a storage location. When you access a variable by its name, you are accessing a specific location on your machine's memory. In Scala there are two types of variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mutable Variables (**Var**): the value of such a variable can be changed after its declaration. For example, you would use a mutable variable in a for loop. \n",
    "- Immutable Variables (**Val**): the value of such a variable cannot be changed after its declaration. For example, you would use an immutable variable if a value is not supposed to change in a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "var someVariable: String = \"value\"\n",
    "// ... some very interesting code\n",
    "someVariable = \"another value\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val someVariable: String = \"value\"\n",
    "// ... some very interesting code\n",
    "someVariable = \"another value\" // this line would not compile.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### If, Else Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "As in many languages, Scala also has control structures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "var bootcamp = 'Jedha';\n",
    "\n",
    "if( bootcamp == 'Jedha' ){\n",
    "    println(\"This is a great bootcamp.\");\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    println(\"This is a good bootcamp.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also achieve the same as a one-liner\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "var bootcamp = 'Jedha';\n",
    "\n",
    "println(if (bootcamp == 'Jedha') \"This is a great bootcamp.\" else \"This is a good bootcamp.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala offers many types of data structures ready to use. They can be grouped per category: list, map, tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### List\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to python, a List is a data structure that can represent multiple elements of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val someList = List(1,2,3)\n",
    "someList(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you can also create a range  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val rangeList = List.range(1,10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Lists are immutable in Scala, if you want to update the 2nd element of the list the operation will return a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "someList.updated(1,5)\n",
    "println(someList)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a mutable structure you can use Array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "var mutableArray = Array(\"Paul\", \"Antoine\", \"Charles\")\n",
    "mutableArray(0) = \"Pierre\"\n",
    "mutableArray\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Map\n",
    "\n",
    "A map in Scala is similar to a dictionary in Python. For each key you can access the corresponding value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val studentGradeMap = Map(\"Paul\" -> 0, \"Antoine\" -> 20, \"Charles\" -> 17)\n",
    "studentGradeMap(\"Paul\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to List, Map is immutable. For example, if you remove an element, it will create a new map.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "studentGradeMap.contains(\"Paul\") // returns True\n",
    "val newMap = studentGradeMap.-(\"Paul\")\n",
    "newMap.contains(\"Paul\") // returns False \n",
    "studentGradeMap.contains(\"Paul\") // returns True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala tuple groups a predefined number of items together. Unlike an array or list, a tuple can group objects with \n",
    "different types. Note that tuples are also immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val myTuple = (1, \"Paul\", true)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to access the 2nd element of the tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "myTuple._2\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions and methods in Scala are two representations of the same concepts. They are different in the way we use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a callable unit of code. It takes an input and transforms it to an output. The purpose is to be able to reuse this piece of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val linearFunction = (x: Double) => 2*x + 1\n",
    "linearFunction(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, a function is an object and can be passed as a parameter of another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val functionOfAFunction = (x: Double, f: Double => Double) => f(x) + 1\n",
    "functionOfAFunction(2, linearFunction)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions that are part of a class or an object. Methods of a class will be detailed when we introduce the \n",
    "object concept in Scala tomorrow. So far we only learned about one specific object holding the main method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "object HelloWorld {\n",
    "    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n",
    "        println(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "We can define another method\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "object HelloWorld {\n",
    "\n",
    "    def lenghtOfString(inputString: String): Int = {\n",
    "        inputString.length()\n",
    "    } \n",
    "\n",
    "    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n",
    "        println(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in Scala you do not need a return statement, the last variable of the method will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "As in Python, a loop is a control structure that allows you to repeat a statement with different arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic for loop. The command is executed a predefined number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for( it <- 1 to 10){\n",
    "    println(f\"iteration: $it\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop. The command is executed until a boolean expression turns to `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "var a = 10;\n",
    "\n",
    "while( a < 20 ){\n",
    "    println( \"Value of a: \" + a );\n",
    "    a = a + 1;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How to iterate over an array?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val names = List(\"Paul\", \"Antoine\", \"Charles\");\n",
    "\n",
    "for( name <- names ){\n",
    "    println(f\"my name is $name\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the power of scala you can apply a function to an array. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val collection = List(1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6) \n",
    "  \n",
    "val squaredCollection = collection.map(x => x * x) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return a new array where the function `x => x * x` is applied to each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have many possibilities to apply a function to every element of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "collection.filter(x => x > 4)\n",
    "// returns all element superior to 4: List(5, 7, 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "collection.reduce((total, cur) => total + cur)\n",
    "// returns the sum of all elements of the list: 28\n",
    "\n",
    "collection.filter(x => x > 4).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur)\n",
    "// you can chain operations on a List, here you filter first and sum afterwards.\n",
    "// return 5+7+6=18\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the documentation of [List](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.7.0/scala/List.html) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
