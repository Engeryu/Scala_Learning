    "# Functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming (FP) is based on a simple paradigm with many implications: \n",
    "**we construct our programs using only pure functions.** This means that the functions have no side-effect. A \n",
    "side-effect is when a function does more than returning a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a function with side-effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def functionWithSideEffect(var a, var b) = {\n",
    "    b = 3 * a + 5\n",
    "    b\n",
    "}\n",
    "```   \n",
    "\n",
    "This dummy example returns a linear transformation of `a` and at the same time changes the value of `b`.\n",
    "A more realistic example would be a function that would calculate and write the result in a database. Writing in the database is considered a side-effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using functional programming is beneficial because of the increase in modularity that we gain from programming functions with no side effects. \n",
    "Because of the modularity, the code is easier to test, reuse, parallelize, generalize, and reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function without side-effects is called a pure function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container types\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {\n",
    "    if(b==0)\n",
    "        throw new ArithmeticException(\"division by 0\")\n",
    "    a / b\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is lying to you. When you consider only the inputs and outputs, you cannot tell that `0` is not a \n",
    "valid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala offers you the possibility to return a result for every output. It is called `Either` and therefore sees the inputs \n",
    "in the function's signature. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Either[DivisionError, Int] = {\n",
    "    if(b==0) Left(DivisionError(\"division by 0\"))\n",
    "    Right(a / b)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then use the Either object with case matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val divison: Either[DivisionError, Int] = divide(1,10)\n",
    "\n",
    "println( result divison {\n",
    "  case Right(x) => f\"The result is: $x\"\n",
    "  case Left(x) => x.stacktrace\n",
    "})\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Function signature that you can use to write pure function. They are called container types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Option`, the result might be present or not\n",
    "- `Either`, the result can take two value\n",
    "- `Future`, the value might be available in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with `Option`. All pizzas are stored in a hashmap referenced by id.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val pizzas = Map[String, Pizza]\n",
    "\n",
    "def findPizza(id: String): Option[Pizza] = {\n",
    "    pizzas.get(id) // the get method of a Map already returns Option[Pizza]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val myPizza = findPizza(\"margarita\")\n",
    "\n",
    "myPizza.isDefined // returns true is the pizza was found\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with `Future`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import scala.concurrent.{Future}\n",
    "import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\n",
    "import scala.util.{Failure, Success}\n",
    "\n",
    "val f: Future[String] = Future {\n",
    "  Thread.sleep(10000) // wait for 10s\n",
    "  \"future has finished\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "f.isCompleted // returns false\n",
    "Thread.sleep(10000)\n",
    "f.isCompleted // returns true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have a build-in method to wait for the future\n",
    "```\n",
    "f.onComplete {\n",
    "    case Success(value) => println(s\"The future is completed: $value\")\n",
    "    case Failure(e) => e.printStackTrace\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "> A functional data structure is operated on using only pure\n",
    "> functions. Remember, a pure function may only accept some values as input and\n",
    "> yield a value as output. It may not change data in place or perform other side\n",
    "> effects. Therefore, functional data structures are immutable.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Source: Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you want to change a field of your object, you will create another object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non Functional example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Pizza(var name: String, var cookingTime: Int) \n",
    "\n",
    "margarita = new Pizza(\"margarita\", 30)\n",
    "margarita.cookingTime = 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Pizza(val name: String, val cookingTime: Int) = {\n",
    "    def copyWithCookingTime(var newCookingTime: Int): Pizza = {\n",
    "        new Pizza(name, newCookingTime)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a major aspect in pure functional programming. Scala supports recursion functions very well. \n",
    "Recursion means a function can call itself repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating factorial is a classic recursion example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def factorial(n: BigInt): BigInt = {  \n",
    "  if (n <= 1)\n",
    "     1  \n",
    "  else    \n",
    "  n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion helps to remove side effects that are performed while writing loops. It also makes code more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher-order functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as parameters and can return another function.\n",
    "They are used for reducing boilerplate code. Therefore, it reduces maintenance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sum` is a function that will sum `f(a) + f(a+1) + ... f(b) \n",
    "```\n",
    "def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int =\n",
    "  if (a > b) 0 else f(a) + sum(f, a + 1, b)\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass as parameter any function such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def identity(x: Int) = x\n",
    "def cube(x: Int) = x * x * x\n",
    "```"
