    "\n",
    "The first step is to install Java. Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html\" target=\"_blank\">Download the JDK version</a> for your operating system.\n",

    "### Compiling and Executing Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Python, Scala needs to be compiled before the program can run. This means the code you write will be converted into commands the java virtual machine (JVM) can understand. \n",
