    "# Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are design patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns are a reusable way to solve a well-known and common problem. It is not a finished code like a library,\n",
    "but a set a best practice to implement a custom-fit solution to your use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns are accepted solutions that will help you avoid issues and improve your productivity as a developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factory method\n",
    "\n",
    "> The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Factory method allows to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Merge complex object creation code\n",
    "- Select which class to instantiate\n",
    "- Cache objects\n",
    "- Coordinate access to shared resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example in Scala:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "trait Pizza\n",
    "private class Margarita extends Pizza\n",
    "private class Fungi extends Pizza\n",
    "\n",
    "object Pizza {\n",
    "  def apply(kind: String) = kind match {\n",
    "    case \"margarita\" => new Margarita()\n",
    "    case \"fungi\" => new Fungi()\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "Pizza(\"margarita\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Singleton\n",
    "\n",
    "> The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one \"single\" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Source <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We already saw this pattern earlier when we introduced the `class` and `object` in Scala.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "object Oven {\n",
    "\n",
    "  def bake(pizza: Pizza): Future[Pizza] {\n",
    "    // 1. Add the pizza to the stack of pizza \n",
    "    // 2. Wait until all other pizzas before in the stack have been baked\n",
    "    // 3. Wait for the duration of the baking time\n",
    "    // 4. Remove the pizza from the stack \n",
    "    // 5. Return the baked pizza as a Future\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "bakedMargarita: Future[Pizza] = Oven.bake(new Margarita())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you need to imagine that the oven is a real machine that can stack the pizza and automatically place \n",
    "the pizza from the stack into the oven.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having the Oven as a singleton allows us to control that the Pizza's are baked synchronously. \n",
    "If we would have a class Oven with multiple instances it would be much more complicated to control synchronous baking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value object\n",
    "\n",
    "> A value object is a small object that represents a simple entity whose equality is not based on identity: i.e. two value objects are equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being the same object.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Source <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very usefull pattern to start using in Scala. The idea is to avoid such code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def getPointWithinBoudaries(minLat: Double, maxLat: Double, minLon: Double, maxLon: Double) = {}  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very easy to mix up the variable when calling this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we create a type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "type Point = (Int, Int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and the function becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def getPointWithinBoudaries(topLeft: Point, bottomRight: Point) = {}  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency injection\n",
    "\n",
    "> Dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on. These other objects are called dependencies. In the typical \"using\" relationship the receiving object is called a client and the passed (that is, \"injected\") object is called a service. The code that passes the service to the client can be many kinds of things and is called the injector. Instead of the client specifying which service it will use, the injector tells the client what service to use.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Source <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many frameworks such a Spring and Play allow you to implement this pattern with annotation. This example is here for the\n",
    "purpose of understanding the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "trait Repository {\n",
    "  def save(user: User)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "trait DatabaseRepository extends Repository { /* ... */ }\n",
    "\n",
    "trait UserService { self: Repository => // requires Repository\n",
    "  def create(user: User) {\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "    save(user)\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "new UserService with DatabaseRepository\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some References\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software** is a reference as it explains the most important \n",
    "patterns. The only downside is that the examples are written in C++.\n",
    "- **Scala Design Patterns by Ivan Nikolov** is a very good read. It focuses on design patterns applied specifically to the Scala language.\n"
